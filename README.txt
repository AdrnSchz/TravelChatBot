The chatbot has been developed and tested using Python 3.10.4, however, it should work with any version of Python.

The steps to execute the chatbot are:

1. Install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure it is properly set in the Path environment variable
2. Set the project's directory as working/current directory (using cd)
3. Execute in a terminal prompt using "python chatbot.py"


During the first execution, required packages will be downloaded. The chatbot will not be available until packages are successfully downloaded.
Once it is running, simply input any desired query and a response will be given.

Note that some few functionalities mentioned in the code are yet to be implemented for the next delivery phase as this implementation is a basic one, as requested.

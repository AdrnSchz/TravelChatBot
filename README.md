# TravelChatbot
A project implementing a travel recommender through a chatbot as intermediary. It will recommend, inform or propose based on the user's input countries, places or locations to go, its flora and fauna, food, living prices, landscapes, monuments...

## Execution
The chatbot has been developed and tested using Python 3.10.4, however, it should work with any version of Python.

The steps to execute the chatbot are:

1. Install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure it is properly set in the Path environment variable
2. Set the project's directory as working/current directory (using cd)
3. Execute in a terminal prompt using "python chatbot.py"


During the first execution, required packages will be downloaded. The chatbot will not be available until packages are successfully downloaded.

Once it is running, simply input any desired query and a response will be given.

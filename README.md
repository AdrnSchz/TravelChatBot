# TravelChatbot
A project implementing a travel recommender through a chatbot as intermediary. It will recommend, inform or propose based on the user's input countries, places or locations to go, its flora and fauna, food, living prices, landscapes, monuments...

## Execution
The chatbot has been developed and tested using Python 3.10.4, however, it should work with any version of Python 3.

We recommend installing Anaconda as it brings all required libraries installed. The libraries used are math, csv, pandas, string, nltk, collections, sklearn and tkinter.

The steps to execute the chatbot are:

1. Install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure it is properly set in the Path environment variable
2. Set the project's directory as working/current directory (using cd)
3. If Anaconda is not being used, install the required dependencies using pip3 install <lib> for each dependency mentioned above
4. Execute in a terminal prompt using "python chatbot.py"

Should there be a dependency problem, execute pip3 install with the dependency in question.

During the first execution, required packages will be downloaded. The chatbot will not be available until packages are successfully downloaded.

Once it is running, simply input any desired query through the UI and a response will be given.

Some examples inputs are:

    what can you tell me about spain
    is spain safe
    how are the beaches in spain
    how is the cuisine in spain
    tell me about the climate of spain
    what is the currency of spain
